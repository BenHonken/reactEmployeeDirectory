## Description

This is a employee directory by Ben Honken.  It uses react to update search results and sorting as you type and click.  The search field will check first name, last name, email, city, and state for a match, and populate all results to the table.  The results can be sorted by any of these fields, and the order can be switched between ascending and decending.

Here is a demo of the functionality.  

## Usage

As a manager, I want to be able to quickly access information about my employees so that I can stay organized and easily manage my company.
